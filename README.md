# movie-aplication v1.0

Web application made in HTML, CSS and Javascript with the help of a movie web API.

It works through an asynchronous function that takes the value of the search input and throws it into the API URL, using the input value and the API key as parameters. Soon after, the film's information (type, genre, release date, IMDB ratings, title and film poster) are displayed on the screen.
